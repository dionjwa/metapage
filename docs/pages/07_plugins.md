Plugins are metaframes (websites) that have inputs from the metapage where they are embedded.

Features:

 - display a visual representation of the metapage
 - save and load the state (current inputs) of the metapage
 - editing the metapage
  
https://app.metapage.org heavily uses plugins, but they are an optional feature.

Security: they also increase the surface area, so only run plugins that you trust. All plugins from metapage.org are open-source.
