## Markdown viewer metaframe

Displays formatted markdown.

You can send the raw markdown:

### via input pipes

Send any markdown text on any input pipe and this page will display the formatted markdown.

Some named pipes are special however:

`*json`: any pipe *ending with* json will be shown as a formatted markdown code block

### via URL parameter:

	https://metapages.org/metaframes/metaframe-markdown-it/?url=https://my.markdown.content

This downloads the content at `https://my.markdown.content` and shows the content as markdown.
